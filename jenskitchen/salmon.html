    <h1> Garlic Salmon </h1>
    <p>this is one of my favorite recipes for when folks come over for dinner. I've already shared this popular recipe with many of my friends. The best thing is it's <em>so easy</em> to make!</p>

    <ul>
        <li>1/4 c. dry sherry</li>
        <li>2 T. soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 T. vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 t. dry mustard</li>
        <li>3-4 T. freshly minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 to 2 lbs salmon filets</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix toether firth 5 ingredients in a shallow dish. Place cleaned and deboned salmon fillets face down in the mixture and to marinate for 1/2 to 1 hour. (Tip, I cut a large of salmon into the serving sizes before marinating so the marinade can coar the sides of each piece as well.)</li>
        <li>Preheat the broiler. Transfer filets to a baking sheet, skin-down. Broil the salmon on the top rack for 7 to 9 minutes, or until done to your liking (I like it still pink in the center).</li>
        <li>I usually serve this with an aromatic rice and a lightly seasoned stir fry.</li>
    </ol>
